# Multi-Board Support: Critical Information Needs

## Summary

This document outlines the specific information, decisions, and resources needed to successfully implement multi-board support for Xiao and Qt Py form factors with the Signal Distribution MkII carrier board.

## Immediate Information Needs

### üîß Hardware Compatibility Verification

#### **1. Physical Board Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING**

**What's Needed:**
- **Signal Distribution MkII + Multiple Boards**: Physical testing with:
  - Seeed XIAO SAMD21, RP2040, ESP32C3/C6
  - Adafruit Qt Py RP2040, CH32V203
- **Pin Mapping Validation**: Verify each pin assignment works correctly
- **Voltage Level Testing**: Confirm 3.3V/5V compatibility
- **Mechanical Fit**: Ensure castellated pads align properly

**Why Critical:**
Without physical validation, the entire proposal assumes compatibility that may not exist.

#### **2. Power Consumption Analysis (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDED FOR OPTIMIZATION**

**What's Needed:**
- **Current draw measurements** for each board type during:
  - Idle operation
  - Active flight control
  - GPS tracking
  - Maximum peripheral load
- **Battery life projections** for portable applications
- **Power supply requirements** for different board combinations

### üìä Performance Benchmarking

#### **3. Processing Performance Comparison (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDED FOR OPTIMIZATION**

**What's Needed:**
- **Flight control loop timing** on each architecture
- **GPS parsing performance** across different UARTs
- **Servo response timing** and accuracy measurements
- **Memory usage patterns** during flight operations

**Deliverable:** Performance comparison matrix showing:
```
| Board | Loop Time | GPS Parse | Memory Usage | Flight Stability |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| SAMD21| 2.5ms     | 1.2ms     | 24KB        | Excellent        |
| RP2040| 1.8ms     | 0.9ms     | 28KB        | Excellent        |
| ESP32 | 1.5ms     | 0.7ms     | 45KB        | Good             |
```

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Decisions

#### **4. Memory Management Strategy (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Status:** üî∂ **DECISION REQUIRED**

**Decision Points:**
- **Parameter Storage**: How to handle 10KB (CH32V203) vs 8MB (ESP32S3) Flash?
- **Flight Data Buffering**: Scale GPS recording based on available RAM?
- **Code Size**: Optimize for smallest target or create tiered builds?

**Options:**
1. **Lowest Common Denominator**: Limit all features to smallest board
2. **Tiered Feature Sets**: Basic/Advanced/Premium feature levels
3. **Dynamic Scaling**: Runtime feature detection and allocation

#### **5. Wireless Capability Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status:** üî∂ **DECISION REQUIRED**

**Decision Points:**
- **ESP32 WiFi/BLE**: Add telemetry features or keep disabled?
- **Protocol Selection**: HTTP, MQTT, custom protocol for telemetry?
- **Power Impact**: Balance wireless features vs flight time?
- **Security**: Authentication and encryption requirements?

**Options:**
1. **Disabled by Default**: Maintain current serial-only approach
2. **Optional Enhancement**: WiFi telemetry as additional feature
3. **Core Integration**: Redesign around wireless-first architecture

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Infrastructure Needs

#### **6. Multi-Board Testing Setup (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED**

**What's Needed:**
- **Hardware Test Bench**: Automated testing across multiple boards
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build verification for all supported targets
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing boards

**Components Required:**
- Multiple development boards of each type
- Automated switching/programming setup
- Standardized test procedures and pass/fail criteria

#### **7. Documentation and Support Framework (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status:** üî∂ **PROCESS DECISION**

**Decisions Required:**
- **Support Commitment**: Which boards get full vs community support?
- **Documentation Depth**: How detailed should board-specific guides be?
- **Community Integration**: How to accept/validate community board additions?

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **High-Risk Areas:**

   - *Mitigation*: Tiered feature approach, optional components

### **Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ **90%+ feature parity** across supported boards
- ‚úÖ **Zero flight-critical regressions** from multi-board changes
- ‚úÖ **<15% code size increase** for smallest boards

- [ ] **Feature differentiation policy** (which features are board-specific)
- [ ] **Support tier definitions** (community vs official support levels)
- [ ] **Testing framework scope** (automated vs manual validation)

## Information Still Unknown

### **Critical Unknowns:**
1. **Signal Distribution Signal Quality**: Do all boards generate equivalent PWM signals?
2. **Real-World Flight Performance**: How do different MCUs affect flight stability?
3. **Long-Term Reliability**: Are all boards equally suitable for flight applications?
4. **Supply Chain Considerations**: Availability and lifecycle of each board type?

### **Research Required:**
- **Flight testing results** with different MCU architectures
- **Environmental stress testing** (temperature, vibration, EMI)
- **Long-term reliability data** from similar applications
- **Cost-benefit analysis** for each supported board type

This comprehensive analysis provides the roadmap for expanding board support while maintaining system reliability and development efficiency.
