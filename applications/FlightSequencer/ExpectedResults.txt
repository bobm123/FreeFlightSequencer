--- LED Status Patterns ---
Ready State: Double blink heartbeat (red, off, red, off, long pause)
Armed State: Fast continuous blinking (100ms on/off)
Motor Spool: Solid red LED  
Motor Run: Solid red LED
Glide Phase: Slow blink (500ms on/off cycle)
DT Deploy: Solid red LED during deployment
Landing: Single slow blink (50ms on, 2950ms off)

--- Button Operations ---
Ready → Armed: Long press button 1.5+ seconds (LED changes to fast blink)
Armed → Launch: Short press to release button (motor starts spooling)
Emergency Shutoff: Press button during Motor Spool, Motor Run, or Glide (immediate motor stop)
Reset: Long press button 1.5+ seconds in Landing state (return to Ready)

--- Flight Timing (with mm:ss timestamps) ---
System Armed: ~00:05 after startup
Launch: ~00:07 (2 seconds after arm)
Motor at Speed: ~00:10 (3 second spool ramp)
Motor Run Complete: ~00:25 (15 second motor run with custom params)
DT Deploy: ~01:37 (90 second total flight with custom params)
Flight Complete: ~01:39 (2 second DT deployment hold)
System Reset: ~01:45 (user long-press to reset)

Note: Timer resets to 00:00 when returning to Ready state for new flight

--- Servo Positions ---
Motor Idle: 950µs PWM pulse
Motor Flight: 1500µs PWM pulse  
DT Retracted: 1000µs PWM pulse
DT Deployed: 2000µs PWM pulse
