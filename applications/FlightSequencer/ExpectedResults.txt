--- LED Status Patterns ---
Ready State: Double blink heartbeat (red, off, red, off, long pause)
Armed State: Fast continuous blinking (100ms on/off)
Motor Spool: Solid red LED  
Motor Run: Solid red LED
Glide Phase: Slow blink (500ms on/off cycle)
DT Deploy: Solid red LED during deployment
Landing: Single slow blink (50ms on, 2950ms off)

--- Button Operations ---
Ready → Armed: Long press button 1.5+ seconds (LED changes to fast blink)
Armed → Launch: Short press to release button (motor starts spooling)
Emergency Shutoff: Press button during Motor Spool, Motor Run, or Glide (immediate motor stop)
Reset: Long press button 1.5+ seconds in Landing state (return to Ready)

--- Flight Timing ---
Motor Spool: ~3 seconds (smooth ramp from 950µs to 1500µs)
Motor Run: 10.0 seconds at 1500µs PWM
Glide Phase: Remaining time until 30.0 seconds total elapsed
DT Deploy: 2.0 seconds deployment, then retract
Total Flight: 30.0 seconds from launch to landing

--- Servo Positions ---
Motor Idle: 950µs PWM pulse
Motor Flight: 1500µs PWM pulse  
DT Retracted: 1000µs PWM pulse
DT Deployed: 2000µs PWM pulse
