# LED Button Application - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Simple interactive application that demonstrates basic GPIO control using button input and NeoPixel LED output. This application serves as the foundation for more complex user interfaces in flight control systems.

## Purpose
- Validate basic hardware abstraction layer (HAL) components
- Establish reliable button debouncing and LED control patterns
- Create reusable components for future applications
- Demonstrate finite state machine design patterns

## Hardware Requirements
- Adafruit QT Py SAMD21 development board
- Onboard push button (A0) with internal pullup
- Onboard NeoPixel LED (pin 11)
- USB connection for serial monitoring

## Functional Requirements

### Button Input Handling
- **Debounced Press Detection**: Reliable press/release detection with configurable debounce timing
- **Short Press Actions**: Single press responses (< 1 second hold)
- **Long Press Actions**: Extended hold responses (≥ 1 second hold)
- **Interrupt-Driven Input**: Non-blocking input handling using hardware interrupts

### LED Output Control
- **Color Control**: Display primary colors (Red, Green, Blue) and combinations
- **Brightness Control**: Adjustable brightness levels for different operational modes
- **Pattern Display**: Ability to show status patterns (solid, blinking, fading)
- **Power Management**: LED off state for power conservation

### User Interface Modes
- **Idle Mode**: LED off, waiting for user input
- **Color Cycle Mode**: Button press cycles through colors (Red → Green → Blue → Off)
- **Brightness Adjust Mode**: Long press enters brightness adjustment mode
- **Status Display Mode**: Show system status through LED patterns

### Serial Interface
- **Status Reporting**: Real-time status messages following established ASCII format
- **Debug Output**: Configurable debug information for development
- **User Feedback**: Clear indication of button presses and mode changes
- **Error Reporting**: Notification of any operational issues

## Behavioral Specifications

### State Machine Design
```
IDLE → [Short Press] → COLOR_CYCLE → [Timeout] → IDLE
IDLE → [Long Press] → BRIGHTNESS_ADJUST → [Release] → IDLE
COLOR_CYCLE → [Short Press] → Next Color
COLOR_CYCLE → [Long Press] → BRIGHTNESS_ADJUST
```

### Button Response Timing
- **Debounce Period**: 50ms minimum for reliable press detection
- **Short Press**: < 1000ms button hold duration
- **Long Press**: ≥ 1000ms button hold duration  
- **Auto-Return Timeout**: 10 seconds of inactivity returns to IDLE

### LED Color Sequence
1. **Red**: Full intensity (255, 0, 0)
2. **Green**: Full intensity (0, 255, 0)
3. **Blue**: Full intensity (0, 0, 255)
4. **Off**: LED disabled (0, 0, 0)

### Brightness Levels
- **Level 1**: 64 (25% brightness)
- **Level 2**: 128 (50% brightness)  
- **Level 3**: 192 (75% brightness)
- **Level 4**: 255 (100% brightness)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Response Time**: Button press acknowledgment within 100ms
- **State Transitions**: Smooth transitions without visible delays
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient use of SAMD21 RAM and Flash resources
- **Power Consumption**: LED off state for battery-powered operation

### Reliability
- **Debounce Effectiveness**: No false triggering under normal use
- **State Consistency**: Reliable state machine operation
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of unexpected conditions
- **Long-term Operation**: Stable operation for extended periods

### Code Quality
- **HAL Components**: Reusable button and LED abstraction layers
- **FSM Implementation**: Clean state machine following established patterns
- **Documentation**: Clear code comments and usage examples
- **Testing**: Validation against expected behavior patterns

## Success Criteria
